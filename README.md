# Neural Network Color Classifier
This project is a simple web application that uses a neural network to classify colors. The neural network is trained on a set of RGB color values mapped to color names. The neural network then uses this training to predict the name of a color given a new set of RGB values.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Node.js
npm
## Installation
* Clone the repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neural-network-color-classifier.git
* Navigate to the project directory
bash
Copy code
cd neural-network-color-classifier
* Install the dependencies
bash
Copy code
npm install
* Run the application
bash
Copy code
npm start
## Usage
After you've started the application, you can access it in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.

The application displays a bar chart that shows the neural network's predictions for a given color. The x-axis of the chart represents the different color names, and the y-axis represents the confidence of the neural network's prediction.
